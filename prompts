Start with a splash page with login and regsiter buttons for a site called "traffic" that helps engineers learn how to handle scaling issue in a simulator. Give me a test user username "andrewarrow" password "testing". Once logged in have a logout button.

Make the logged in root page a very complicated UI throwing the user right into the deep end
of running a major site like reddit (call it something generic like forums) with millions of users.
There should be some core graphs like number of redis cluster nodes, their cpu %, number
of pods, their memory and cpu %, and all sorts of bells and whistles. There should be a
time window display of "last 4 hours" that can change to various other times. Data should constantly
be flowing in and changing. 

make the charts smaller and with a single thin line

the charts are the perfect size now but the blue line goes below the bottom. Also the blue line is
   still think and pixated.

replace the top nav where it says Dashboard, Content, Users, Analytics, Infrastructure to
a slider that has number of users as it's data. The first item "Forums" can stay but change to
the name "traffic". On the left side of the slider should be 1 user and on the right 1 million.
The slider should start all the way to the right side. As the user slides the slider to the left
the number of users should go down and down. As the number of users goes down so does the
complexity of the UI. When you get to all the way to the left side of the slider and just 1 user
the UI should be only for a single ec2 instance with sqlite as the database and nothing else.
