# shellmates

Rent bare metal servers and create your own micro-cloud with friends.

Split costs, maximize resources, and build a community of developers.
How shellmates Works

    1. Rent a powerful bare metal server from providers like Hetzner or OVH at prices starting from $34.50/month
    2. We help you setup Firecracker VMs to divide your server into smaller VMs
    3. Keep what you need and rent out the rest to other developers at fair prices
    4. Save up to 90% compared to cloud providers like AWS while building relationships with other developers
